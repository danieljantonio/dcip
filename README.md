### Research
- [ ] Dynamic threads in python
- [ ] How much load does each thread add, is it worthed to use threads in consideration of performance, time, and power consumption?
- [ ] How to speed up an area with huge chunks of text
- [ ] EAST text detection using binary image
- [ ] How long does it take to binary threshold a small image
- [ ] Detect areas where the text is chunked together (try to increase the padding, then use non_max_suppression with a lower overlapThresh)
